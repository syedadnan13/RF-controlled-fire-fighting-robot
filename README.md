# RF-controlled-fire-fighting-robot
In this project, an RF based fire-fighting and affected area monitoring robot is proposed. This fire-fighting robot can be used as a supplementary to the fire fighters in critical situations.The robot can run in both manual control system and autonomic control system.
# Problem Statement
Design and Implementation of Fire Fighting robot based on real-time system. The security of home, laboratory, office, factory and building is important to human life. Therefore we develop security  system  that contains a fire protection robot using sensor.
# OBJECTIVES
1. The main objective is to develop a RF operated fire fighting robot for fire extinguishing activities.
2. To implement a robot capable of interacting with the user to and from a remote location. It should be easy to operate and safe handling.
3. RF based fire fighting robot is very useful and convenient machine and the fireman can easily extinguish the fire and save people, goods from damage.
4. To reduce human effort in the fire extinguishing activities.

# Conclusion
In this project, a firefighting and affected area monitoring robot is proposed based on the RF module, which is capable of taking instant steps  during fire accidents. This robot can be used to reduce the risk of human firefighters and in the area which is out of reach for human beings. The industries with a higher risk of fire accidents can use this robot to avoid huge damages. 

# Future scope
The firefighting robot will have future scope that it can work with firefighters, which   greatly reduce the danger of injury to victims. It is a innovative work in the field of robotics that operates towards a sensible and obtainable access to save the lives and prevents the danger to property.
In future venture, video monitoring can be done for the field to be monitored more accurately. More advanced and fast system can be developed with more focus on implementation of right mechanical parts and their designing. Implementation of advanced sensors would control the motion of the robot even under worst field conditions. Use of ultrasonic sensors and cameras for measuring the area covered by the robot improves the performance of the robot.
